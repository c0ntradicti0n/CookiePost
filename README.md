# CookiePost

Are you interested in knowing, what happens with their cookies?
Here you can have just a browser button, to get you one click away from the
mail.

According to EU law you may ask for that:

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&qid=1622635289752&from=DE#d1e2528-1-1

By pressing the button, it:

* scrapes the impressum of a site for getting the support email.
* forwards you with a "mailto"-link to your favorite email app
* has prefilled the mail with data, as you will need:

    * your name
    * birth
    * address

    * it makes a REQUEST to tell them YOUR ip, which they put the cookies by asking: https://ipapi.co/json/
    * time of access

they even may ask for your passport to hand out your data, but at least, they try to
make sure it's your data.

So be careful, even for restoring privacy you have to tell everything.

You can add it from source files in the browser or maybe soon from Mozilla/Chrome, let's see.
